# Template Generator

This application allows to generate a microservice boilerplate. Cross-cutting concerns such as configuration, logging are taken into account. The idea is to put everything that is general to microservices.

Several templates can be included to speed up the initial setup process of a service

This project was developed for study purposes only. To use templates to create your projects is better to use a tool like [CookieCutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) for example
